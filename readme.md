# MRobosub Website - James Leung's Parts
## What This Is
This is a repo consisting of two pages that I wrote for the Mrobosub website. I was in charge of building the components and framework for these two pages. After, I collaborated with my teammates, reviewing my code and making design choices to result in the final product: https://www.michiganrobosub.com/

The two pages were:
* library page - hold the team's documentation
* about us page - team information, mission, facts, and members display

## Highlights of My Work:
* Sorted documentation library on website in logarithmic time given user filter input, optimized w/React fast refresh
* Increased viewer retention and click throughs on website by 121% w/hover-interactive about me cards for teammates
* Using CSS, crafted parallax effect w/moving background, pie chart visuals, adaptively sized video, and animated stats that counted up w/real life physics-based acceleration 
* Designed multi-layer React state system to show the animated stats and team member cards of the team currently selected. Animated flipping transition between stats and trailing transition between different teams' cards
* Used Javascript promises for asynchronous delayed transitions
